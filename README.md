# File Search Indexer

## Description
A local file indexing tool that recursively scans directories and provides fast search by name, size, and date. The program can be written in C++ if you're more comfortable working with it

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install required packages if necessary.

Keep in mind that the code must be written in OOP.

- Store results in an index file (JSON/SQLite).
- Implement search by name and extension.
- Add filtering by size and date.
- Sort search results by date, size, or name.
- Add pagination or limits to results.
- Build GUI with `tkinter`.
- Add "recently added" and "duplicate finder" features.
